1. What is Version Control & Why GitHub?
Version control tracks changes in code, making it easy to revert, collaborate, and manage updates. GitHub is popular because it provides cloud storage, collaboration tools, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

2. Setting Up a GitHub Repository

Sign in to GitHub, click New Repository
Name your repo, choose public or private, add a README, and optionally initialize with a .gitignore
Clone it locally using git clone <repo-url>
3. Importance of a README File
A README explains the project's purpose, installation steps, usage, and contributions. It helps developers quickly understand and collaborate effectively.

4. Public vs. Private Repositories

Public: Open to everyone, great for open-source collaboration but less secure.
Private: Restricted access, good for sensitive projects but limits visibility.
5. Making Your First Commit

Create/Edit files
Run git add . to stage changes
Commit with git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push using git push origin main
Commits keep track of code history, allowing easy rollback if needed.
6. Git Branching & Its Importance
Branches let developers work on features separately without affecting the main codebase.

Create: git branch new-feature
Switch: git checkout new-feature
Merge: git merge new-feature into main
7. Pull Requests & Code Reviews
A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes into the main branch. It enables code review, feedback, and collaboration. Steps:

Push changes to a feature branch
Open a PR on GitHub
Review and approve changes
Merge into main
8. Forking vs. Cloning

Forking: Creates an independent copy of a repository under your account (useful for contributing to open-source projects).
Cloning: Downloads a repo to your local machine for development.
9. Issues & Project Boards
GitHub Issues help track bugs and tasks, while project boards organize work in a kanban-style format. Example: Using Issues for bug reports and Project Boards for sprint planning.

10. Common Challenges & Best Practices

Challenge: Merge conflicts → Solution: Regularly pull the latest changes.
Challenge: Poor commit messages → Solution: Use descriptive commits (git commit -m "Fix login bug").
Challenge: Accidental deletions → Solution: Use branches and avoid force-pushing.
